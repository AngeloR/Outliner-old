<p>The Outliner features automatic update functionality. It scans <code>
http://updates.outliner.xangelo.ca</code> and matches the versions. If the version on 
the server is greater than the version installed it asks you if you want to 
update your install. You are under no obligation to update to a new version of 
the Outliner, but generally, newer versions are preferred.</p>

<p>If you have unofficial plugins installed, please ensure that the plugin 
supports the new version before you update it. If something breaks, you may not 
be able to get back into your installation without manually undo-ing the 
install. Lucky for you, our install system generates a dump of the database 
right before the install (assuming you have our official Backup plugin. If you 
don't make sure that you back up your database however you choose. </p>
